Well, now you can get all the cardy goodness you need from a handy dandy dotnet global tool.

# dotnet whois

Install globally with `dotnet tool install dotnetwhois -g`

Then, whenever the mood takes you, view a card by `dotnet whois tdwright`.

```
┌───────────────────────┐
│                       │
│ Tom Wright / tdwright │
│                       │
└───────────────────────┘
```

To see someone else's card, just replace `tdwright` with their GitHub username.

# get your own card

To get your own card, simply fork this project and edit `card.json` to have your own details in it.
